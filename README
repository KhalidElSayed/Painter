The Painter app turns the iPhone screen into a virtual canvas. The user paints by dragging one or more fingers across the screen. The line color and thickness can be set by touching the info button in the lower-right corner of the screen. The control panel includes a slider for line width and red, green and blue sliders for line color. As the Line Width slider is moved from left to right, the width of the line increases. At the bot- tom of the screen, two buttons allow the user to turn a finger into an eraser or clear the screen entirely. At any point while painting, the user can shake the iPhone to clear the en- tire drawing from the screen.
